    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Walkabout is a python
        module for Omegalib that provides ground collision and wall
        collisions for CAVE2 applications that have a need for users to
        navigate a virtual space where they can climb stairs, jump off
        platforms, and not walk through walls.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The demo.py file
        contains an example of how to use the module. It also provides a
        simple scene in which one can navigate the space to test
        Walkabout. When running on the desktop use the standard WASD
        keys to walk around the space and click and drag on the mouse to
        turn. In CAVE2 simply use the wand to navigate. You can also
        physically walk through the space. Walkabout will automatically
        adjust terrain height to create the illusion that you are
        walking on the geometry. Similarly attempts to walk into a wall
        will force the virtual world backwards to prevent you from going
        through. All that said it is still possible to crash through
        walls by simply navigating far too quickly through them.<br>

    <h2><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">How Walkabout Works</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Walkabout works by
        firing two rays into the scene. One straight down (step ray)
        from the "knees" (climbable level) and one "forward" and
        slightly downward from your head (collision ray). I say
        "forward" because it is actually firing the ray in the direction
        in which you are walking whether it's forwards, backwards, or
        sideways. The step ray determines how high you need to be moved
        up or down in the world. The collision ray determines if you
        have run into a wall or a relatively high object like a table.
        When a collision is detected Walkabout moves the CAVE2 camera
        back to the spot before you were before the collision. For floor
        collision interpolation is also used so that moving up a step or
        falling to a lower platform isn't done instantaneously. Rather
        it is done over a sequence of frames so that there is a smooth
        transition.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In the API it is
        possible to alter the height of your knee/climbable level as
        well as the angle for the collision ray. The knee is specified
        as a proportion of your head height. So for example, 0.3 means
        0.3 x head height. <br>
